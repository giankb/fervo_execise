# fervo_execise

Using node version 22.18.0 (recommended) or at least 20.19.0
run npm install
run npm start

project available online at: https://fervo-project.netlify.app/

The project is composed of:

- Components: containing all the main components of the project
- Utils: containing utility components such as the loader and, hypothetically, also an error page (not included in this case)
- Models: consisting of models, enums, and extensions
- Services:containing services for the loader and API calls
- Environment: containing host/API information, adaptable (not in this case) to test, staging, and production environments
- Blue-theme: custom theming

I didn’t use a generic form because I believe that an autocomplete provides a better user experience.
